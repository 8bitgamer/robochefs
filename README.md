This is an open source clone of Overcooked featuring netplay.

Controls
________

Left click - Grab
Right click - 'Use'

the 'Use' command is used on item spawners as well as chopping boards.


Additional features
_________

Netplay - Play with as many players as your network can handle! (May or may not be a great idea)
Local coop - Xbox controllers are supported natively. Press 'A' to join at any point during a game.
Local coop/Netplay hybrid - Local players can hop in on the fun while you are playing in a net game.

There isn't much in terms of actual levels for now, but the groundwork is there for the game to be expanded significantly.
With the announcement of Overcooked 2 (which features official netplay) I've decided to make this open source as a learning
tool and/or to make it open to becoming a community project for those who might be interested. (I do want to keep working on this)
